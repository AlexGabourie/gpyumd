# `gpyumd`

`gpyumd` is a a Python3 interface for [GPUMD](https://github.com/brucefan1983/GPUMD). It helps users generate input and process output files based on the details provided by the [GPUMD documentation](https://gpumd.zheyongfan.org/index.php/Main_Page#Inputs_and_outputs_for_GPUMD). It currently supports only the `gpumd` executable, but there are plans to support the `nep` executable in the future. 

Note: This code extends that in the [thermo](https://github.com/AlexGabourie/thermo) package, but has functionality focused specifically on GPUMD.
