Data Loaders
============

The :mod:`~gpyumd.load` module is a set of methods dedicated to loading the `output files`_ from a GPUMD_ simulation into a python environment. The format of the loaded data depends on the file itself, but is usually either an array, or a dictionary of arrays/scalars. Please refer to the documentation for each method.
